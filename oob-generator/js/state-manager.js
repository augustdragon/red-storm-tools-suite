/**
 * OOB Generator - State Management Module
 * 
 * Purpose:
 * - Manage application state (selectedTable, scenarioDate, results, etc.)
 * - Provide state getters and setters
 * - Handle state persistence if needed
 * - Notify subscribers of state changes
 * 
 * Future Responsibilities:
 * - Centralized state storage
 * - State validation and mutation
 * - State history/undo if needed
 * - State persistence (localStorage)
 * 
 * State Properties (from current implementation):
 * - selectedTable: Currently selected OOB table
 * - selectedFaction: NATO or WP
 * - scenarioDate: 'pre' or 'post' (for date-dependent tables)
 * - results: Array of generated flight results
 * - resultCounter: Counter for result IDs
 * - hasGeneratedResults: Flag for results existence
 * - debugMode: Debug mode toggle state
 * 
 * Note: Currently state is managed via global variables in index.html
 * This module will centralize all state management during refactoring.
