# API URL Rewriting
# =================
#
# Routes all requests under /api/ to index.php, which acts as the front
# controller / router for the API. Apache's mod_rewrite (enabled in the
# Dockerfile) processes these rules.
#
# Examples:
#   GET /api/health           → index.php (routed to endpoints/health.php)
#   GET /api/aircraft?faction=NATO → index.php (routed to endpoints/aircraft.php)
#
# The RewriteCond ensures we don't rewrite requests for actual files
# (like this .htaccess itself), only virtual API paths.

RewriteEngine On
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php [QSA,L]
